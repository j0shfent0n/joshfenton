# Problem 3: Shapes and Inheritance
# Create a base class called Shape, which will be inherited by classes Rectangle and Circle.

# Shape Class:
# Attributes: color.
# Methods:
# describe(): prints the shape type and its color.
# Rectangle Class (inherits from Shape):
# Attributes: length, width.
# Methods:
# area(): calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
# Circle Class (inherits from Shape):
# Attributes: radius.
# Methods:
# area(): calculates and returns the area of the circle (use Ï€*r^2).
# Create instances of Rectangle and Circle, set their colors, and calculate their areas.









class Shape():
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color



class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
