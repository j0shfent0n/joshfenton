# Simple Inheritance Example
# Create a Person class with properties like name and age.
# Create a subclass Employee that inherits from Person and adds properties employee_id and position.
# Add a method to Employee to display their full information.

class Person:
    def __init__ (self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.log = []

    def employee_name(self):
         print(f'{self.name}, {self.age}')

    def add_to_log(self):
        self.log.append(self.name)     
              

class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, employee_id, position):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.employee_id = employee_id
        self.position = position
        

    def employee_info(self):
        if not self.log:
             print('This employee\'s name is not in the log, please try again')

            print(f'{self.name}, {self.age}, {self.employee_id}, {self.position}')

    
employee1 = Employee('Josh', 28, 1234, 'star')
employee1.add_to_log()
