# 1. Create a Simple Bank Account System
# Create a BankAccount class that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance.
# The class should have:
# Attributes: balance, account_holder
# Methods: deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), get_balance()
# Make sure to handle cases where the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance.

class BankAccount(object):

    def __init__(self, balance, account_holder):
        self.balance = balance
        self.account_holder = account_holder

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f'Your new balance after depositing ${amount} is ${self.balance}')
        

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
                self.balance -= amount
                print(f'Your new balance after withdrawing ${amount} is ${self.balance}')
        else:
             print(f'You cannot withdraw an amount larger than {self.balance}. Please try a different amount')
            
            
        

    def get_balance(self):
        print(f'Your balance is {self.balance}')

BA.deposit(30)
